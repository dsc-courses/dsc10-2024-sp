    "**Important**: For homeworks, the `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch careless mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (the schedule can be found [here](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or Ed. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. "

    "Bob Ross was an iconic American landscape painter, most well-known for hosting an instructional television show in the 80s and 90s called *The Joy of Painting*. In each episode, Bob Ross taught viewers to paint a different landscape picture while encouraging them to bring out \"the artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.\" The file `data/bob_ross.csv` contains information on individual elements seen within Bob Ross' paintings across 403 episodes. For example, in [Season 1, Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh5p5f5_-7A), Bob shows how to create the painting below, titled \"A Walk in the Woods\".\n",
